# Plugin Development
As mentioned in the [Home](../index.md) page, SharpPluginLoader allows loading C# plugins into the game. This section will explain how to create such plugins.

## Prerequisites
To get started with plugin development you will need to install the latest version of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
In the installer make sure the **.NET desktop development** workload is selected. This will install the .NET SDK and everything else you need to get started.

Now you can move on to the [next page](./GettingStarted.md) to learn how to create your first plugin.
